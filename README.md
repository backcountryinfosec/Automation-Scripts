# Automation-Scripts
Random scripts to automate various things.


## censys_monitor.py
Used to monitor censys.io API for newly created SSL certs that match a specific pattern. Using it as an early detection for new phishing domains. Quite successful so far :).

## viper_monitor.py
Monitors directory and uploads any file that's placed there to the [Viper Framework](https://github.com/viper-framework/viper). Also checks Virus Total for matches with an API key.
